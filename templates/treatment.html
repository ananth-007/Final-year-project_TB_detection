        <h2>TREATMENT FOR LATENT TB INFECTION & TB DISEASE</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tuberculosis (TB) can exist in two states: latent TB infection and
            TB disease. Not everyone who carries the TB bacteria gets sick; some
            have latent TB infection, meaning the bacteria are present but not
            causing illness. However, without treatment, latent TB infection can
            progress to TB disease, which can be fatal if not properly
            addressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treatment is available for both latent TB infection and TB disease.
            Directly observed therapy (DOT) is a method that helps ensure
            patients complete their TB treatment. The Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends video DOT (vDOT) as an
            effective alternative to in-person DOT for individuals undergoing TB
            treatment. This approach involves patients using video technology to
            connect with healthcare providers, allowing for close monitoring and
            support throughout their treatment regimen.

        <h2>LATENT TB INFECTION: WHO NEEDS TREATMENT & WHY?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While latent TB infection itself isn't contagious and doesn't cause
            symptoms, it harbors the potential to turn into active TB disease
            later. This active form of TB can cause coughing, fever, weight
            loss, and fatigue, and can even be fatal if left untreated. To
            prevent this progression, healthcare providers recommend treatment
            for certain high-risk groups.
          </li>
        <br>
        <h3>Why treatment matters:</h3>
        
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Widespread Prevalence:</b> An estimated 13 million people in the US are
            thought to have latent TB infection. This means they carry the TB
            bacteria but haven't developed the active disease.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Risk of Progression:</b> Without treatment, roughly 1 in 10 people with
            latent TB will develop active TB disease at some point in their
            lifetime. This risk can be even higher for people with weakened
            immune systems.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Impact on Vulnerable Populations:</b> Conditions like HIV, diabetes, and
            certain medications can suppress the immune system, making
            individuals more susceptible to TB reactivation. Over 80% of new TB
            cases each year arise from untreated latent TB infection,
            particularly among these vulnerable populations.
          </li>
       
          <br>
      
        <h3>Who should get treated:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Positive TB Blood Test (IGRA):</b> An Interferon Gamma Release Assay
            (IGRA) blood test measures the immune system's response to TB
            exposure. A positive IGRA result indicates current or past TB
            infection, and treatment may be recommended depending on other risk
            factors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Large Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) Reaction (5mm or more):</b> The
            tuberculin skin test (TST) involves injecting a small amount of
            material similar to TB bacteria under the skin. If the body has been
            exposed to TB before, a bump will form at the injection site after
            48-72 hours. A larger bump (5mm or more) suggests a greater
            likelihood of infection, and treatment is advised for certain
            high-risk individuals:
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>HIV positive:</b> People living with HIV have compromised immune
            systems, making them more likely to develop active TB from latent
            infection.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Recent Exposure to Active TB:</b> If you've been in close contact with
            someone diagnosed with active TB, you may have inhaled the bacteria
            and be at higher risk of developing the disease yourself.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Lung Scarring Suggestive of Past TB:</b> Scarring in the lungs, visible
            on a chest X-ray, can indicate a past TB infection that's become
            dormant. Treatment may be recommended to prevent reactivation.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Organ Transplant Recipients:</b> Anti-rejection medications used after
            organ transplants suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of
            TB reactivation.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Taking Immunosuppressant Medications:</b> Certain medications, like
            prednisone (a steroid) or TNF-alpha antagonists used for autoimmune
            diseases, can weaken the immune system and warrant TB treatment for
            latent infection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Very Large TST Reaction (10mm or more):</b> An exceptionally large bump
            (10mm or more) on a TST can indicate a higher chance of active TB
            infection. Treatment is recommended for these high-risk groups:
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Originating from High-TB Burden Countries:</b> Coming from countries
            with a high prevalence of TB, like Mexico, India, or the
            Philippines, increases your risk of exposure and latent infection.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Injection Drug Users:</b> Sharing needles can increase the risk of
            contracting various infections, including TB.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Living or Working in High-Risk Settings:</b> People who reside in
            crowded environments like prisons, nursing homes, or homeless
            shelters have a higher chance of TB exposure. Healthcare workers,
            particularly those in TB labs, are also at increased risk.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Children Under 4:</b> Young children have weaker immune systems, making
            them more susceptible to developing active TB from latent infection.
          </li>
          <li class="key1">
            <b>Exposure to High-Risk Adults:</b> Children and adolescents living with
            or spending significant time around adults in high-risk categories
            may benefit from TB treatment for latent infection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Other Considerations:</b> In some cases, individuals with no identified
            risk factors but a positive IGRA or large TST reaction may also be
            considered for treatment, especially if they're about to undergo
            medical procedures that could suppress the immune system.

        <h2>TREATMENT REGIMENS FOR LATENT TB INFECTION</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Latent TB infection means you have the TB bacteria in your body, but they're inactive and not causing any symptoms. You can't spread TB to others in this stage. However, these inactive bacteria can become active later, leading to full-blown TB disease, which is contagious. Medication can prevent this from happening.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Treatment options</h3>
          <li>There are several antibiotics used to treat latent TB infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) generally prefer shorter treatment regimens (3-4 months) with better completion rates and fewer side effects. Here's a breakdown of the most common options:</li>
          <li class="key1"><b>Three months, once-weekly: Isoniazid (INH) plus Rifapentine (RPT)</b> - This is the gold standard for most people.</li>
          <li class="key2"><b>INH:</b> This medication is the backbone of TB treatment and works well against the bacteria.</li>
          <li class="key2"><b>RPT:</b> This drug helps shorten the treatment duration and improves completion rates compared to INH alone.</li>
          <li class="key1">Four months, daily: Rifampin (RIF) - This is another effective option, but taken daily for a slightly longer period.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Alternative treatments</h3>
          <li>If the shorter regimens aren't suitable due to factors like pregnancy, drug interactions, or certain medical conditions, your doctor might recommend:</li>
          <li class="key1"><b>Six or nine months, daily: Isoniazid (INH)</b> - This is less preferred due to:</li>
          <li class="key2"><b>Higher side effect risk:</b> INH can cause liver problems, so your doctor will monitor your liver function during treatment.</li>
          <li class="key2"><b>Lower completion rates:</b> Taking medication daily for 6-9 months can be challenging, leading to people stopping treatment early.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Factors affecting treatment choice</h3>
          <li>Several factors influence which treatment regimen your doctor chooses:</li>
          <li class="key1"><b>Drug resistance:</b> If you've been exposed to someone with drug-resistant TB, your doctor will need to tailor a specific treatment plan using different medications.</li>
          <li class="key1"><b>Medical conditions:</b> Certain medical conditions like HIV or liver disease might require adjustments to the treatment plan.</li>
          <li class="key1"><b>Medications you're already taking:</b> Some medications can interact with TB drugs, so your doctor needs to consider this when choosing the best option.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>When to see a TB specialist:</h3>
          <li>Consulting a TB specialist is recommended if:</li>
          <li class="key1">The source of your infection has drug-resistant TB.</li>
          <li class="key1">You have complex medical conditions that make treatment decisions challenging.</li>

          <li>There are different treatment plans (regimens) for TB disease in the United States, lasting 4, 6, or 9 months. The best choice depends on several factors.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Types of TB treatment regimens:</h3>
          <li>There are different treatment plans (regimens) for TB disease in the United States, lasting 4, 6, or 9 months. The best choice depends on several factors.</li>
          <li class="key1">4-month Rifapentine-moxifloxacin: This is a newer, shorter option for certain patients. It's effective for drug-sensitive pulmonary TB (TB in the lungs caused by non-resistant bacteria).</li>
          <li class="key1">6- or 9-month RIPE regimen: This is a traditional, longer treatment plan. RIPE stands for the four medications typically used: Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Adverse events during treatment:</h3>
          <li>Patients undergoing treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or active tuberculosis (TB) should promptly inform their healthcare provider about any unusual symptoms they experience, such as:</li>
          <li class="key1">Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, brown urine, or yellowing of the skin or eyes.</li>
          <li class="key1">Persistent tingling, numbness, or burning sensation in the hands or feet.</li>
          <li class="key1">Persistent weakness, fatigue, fever, or abdominal tenderness.</li>
          <li class="key1">Easy bruising or bleeding.</li>
          <li class="key1">Blurred or altered vision.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Patients taking rifampin (RIF) or rifapentine (RPT) should expect their urine and possibly other bodily fluids to turn orange, which is normal. It's important to provide a comprehensive list of current medications to avoid potential drug interactions. Some notable interactions include:</li>
          <li class="key1">Isoniazid (INH) increasing blood levels of phenytoin (Dilantin) and disulfiram (Antabuse).</li>
          <li class="key1">Rifampin (RIF) and rifapentine (RPT) decreasing blood levels of certain drugs including oral contraceptives, warfarin, some anticoagulants, sulfonylureas (for diabetes), and methadone.</li>
          <li class="key1">Rifampin (RIF) and rifapentine (RPT) being contraindicated in HIV-infected individuals being treated with protease inhibitors (PIs) and most nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Healthcare providers administering the combination regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine in 12 once-weekly doses (3HP) should:</li>
          <li class="key1">Educate patients about potential side effects and advise seeking medical attention if they occur.</li>
          <li class="key1">Monitor patients monthly for signs of liver problems, vomiting, or rash.</li>
          <li class="key1">Consider baseline liver function tests for high-risk patients.</li>
          <li class="key1">Follow up on abnormal liver tests and discontinue 3HP for severe cases.</li>
          <li class="key1">Be alert for allergic reactions and manage mild side effects conservatively.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            People who have HIV and either latent TB infection or TB disease can be effectively treated. The initial step involves testing HIV-positive individuals for TB infection, followed by additional tests to confirm or rule out TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection or TB disease is then initiated based on the test results. Luckily, there are various treatment options available for individuals living with HIV and TB infection or disease. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider or local health department for guidance on treatment options.</li>

            <h3>Drug Interactions</h3>
            <li class="key1">Rifamycins, a class of drugs used for treating TB and latent TB infection, can potentially interact with certain antiretroviral medications used for HIV treatment. One concern involves the interaction between rifampin (RIF) and specific antiretroviral agents like protease inhibitors (PIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Rifabutin, which has fewer problematic interactions, might be considered as an alternative to rifampin for HIV-infected individuals.</li>
            <li class="key1">As newer antiretroviral drugs are introduced and more data on pharmacokinetics become available, recommendations for managing these interactions may undergo revisions. It's advisable to consult resources like "Managing Drug Interactions in the Treatment of HIV-Related Tuberculosis" and "Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents" for the latest guidance.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Case Management</h3>
            <li class="key1">In managing cases of HIV-related TB, it's important to utilize directly observed therapy (DOT) and other methods to promote adherence in all patients. The CDC recommends video DOT (vDOT) as a viable alternative to in-person DOT for TB treatment.</li>
            <li class="key1">Care for individuals with HIV-related TB should be overseen by experts in both TB and HIV management. This care should involve meticulous attention to adherence to TB and antiretroviral regimens, monitoring for drug interactions, recognizing paradoxical reactions or Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), managing side effects of medications, and considering the possibility of TB treatment failure or relapse.</li>

        <h2>TREATMENT FOR TB DURING PREGNANCY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Untreated tuberculosis (TB) disease represents a greater hazard to a pregnant woman and her fetus than does its treatment. Treatment should be initiated whenever the probability of TB is moderate to high.</li>
          <li class="key1">Infants born to women with untreated TB may be of lower birth weight than those born to women without TB and, in rare circumstances, the infant may be born with TB.</li>
          <li class="key1">Although the drugs used in the initial treatment regimen for TB cross the placenta, they do not appear to have harmful effects on the fetus.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Treatment for latent TB infection & pregnancy</h3>
          <li class="key1">For most pregnant women, treatment for latent TB infection can be delayed until 2–3 months post-partum to avoid administering unnecessary medication during pregnancy.</li>
          <li class="key1">For women who are at high risk for progression from latent TB infection to TB disease, especially those who are a recent contact of someone with infectious TB disease, treatment for latent TB infection should not be delayed on the basis of pregnancy alone, even during the first trimester.</li>

          <h3>Breastfeeding</h3>
          <li>Breastfeeding should not be discouraged for women being treated with the first-line antituberculosis drugs because the concentrations of these drugs in breast milk are too small to produce toxicity in the nursing newborn. For the same reason, drugs in breast milk are not an effective treatment for TB disease or latent TB infection in a nursing infant.</li>
          <li>Breastfeeding women taking INH should also take pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.  RIF can cause orange discoloration of body fluids, including breast milk. Orange discoloration of body fluids is expected and harmless. There currently is not enough data to indicate whether the 3HP regimen is safe for women to take while breastfeeding.0</li>

        <h2>TB TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Once infected with TB bacteria, children are more likely than adults to get sick with TB disease and to get sick more quickly than adults. In comparison to children, TB disease in adults is usually due to past TB infection that becomes active years later, when a person’s immune system becomes weak for some reason (e.g., HIV infection, diabetes).</li>
          <li>A pediatric TB expert should be involved in the treatment of TB in children and in the management of infants, young children, and immunocompromised children who have been exposed to someone with infectious TB disease. It is very important that children or anyone being treated for latent TB infection or TB disease take the drugs exactly as instructed by the doctor and finish the medicine.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>Latent TB infection treatment for children</h3>
          <li class="key1">Treatment is recommended for children with latent TB infection to prevent them from developing TB disease. Infants, young children, and immunocompromised children with latent TB infection or children in close contact with someone with infectious TB disease, require special consideration because they are at increased risk for getting TB disease. Consultation with a pediatric TB expert is recommended before treatment begins.</li>
          <li class="key1">Children over 2 years of age can be treated for latent TB infection with once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks. Alternative treatments for latent TB infection in children include 4 months of daily rifampin or 9 months of daily isoniazid. The regimens are equally acceptable; however, health care providers should prescribe the more convenient shorter regimens, when possible.  Patients are more likely to complete shorter treatment regimens.</li>
          <br>
          <h3>TB Disease treatment for children</h3>
          <li class="key1">TB disease in children is treated by taking several anti-TB medicines for 4, 6, or 9 months, depending on the treatment regimen. We do not recommend the 4-month rifapentine-moxifloxacin TB treatment regimen for children who are younger than 12 years old or have a body weight below 40 kilograms.</li>
          <li class="key1">If a child stops taking the drugs before completion, the child can become sick again. If drugs are not taken correctly, the bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat, and treatment lasts much longer (up to 18 to 24 months).</li>
